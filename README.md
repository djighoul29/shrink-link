# Shrink Link    

### ðŸ“Œ Description    
Shrink Link is a minimalist web service designed for quickly and conveniently shortening long URLs.  

This project was developed as part of a college assignment, with the main goal of creating a fully functional web application without external frameworks. The backend is powered by **Node.js**, handling server-side logic without additional libraries, while the frontend is styled with **PicoCSS** for a lightweight and responsive design. **Vanilla JavaScript** manages client-side interactions, and shortened links are stored in a **SQLite database**.
